        <h3>First Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of the Lord</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of being open to the Holy Spirit</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 3:1-6, 16; Matthew 3: 13-17</i> <br>
            In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, 
            and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, 
            and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came 
            to Johnb the son of Zechariah in the desert. He went throughout [the] whole region of the Jordan, proclaiming 
            a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet 
            Isaiah: “A voice of one crying out in the desert: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. Every 
            valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The winding roads shall be made straight,
            and the rough ways made smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”... John answered them all, saying,
            “I am baptizing you with water, but one mightier than I is coming. I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his 
            sandals. He will baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire... Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan 
            to be baptized by him. John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you are coming 
            to me?” Jesus said to him in reply, “Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” 
            Then he allowed him. After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened 
            [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove [and] coming upon him. And a voice came from the 
            heavens, saying, “This is my beloved Son,* with whom I am well pleased.”

        <h3>Second Luminous Mystery: The Wedding in Cana</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of going to Jesus through Mary</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>John 2: 1-11</i> <br>
            On the third day there was a wedding* in Cana* in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his 
            disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have 
            no wine.” [And] Jesus said to her, “Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother 
            said to the servers, “Do whatever he tells you.” Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial
            washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them 
            to the brim. Then he told them, “Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” So they took it. And when the 
            headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had 
            drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves good wine first, and 
            then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now.” Jesus did this as 
            the beginning of his signs in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.

        <h3>Third Luminous Mystery: The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God and The Call to Conversion</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of repentance and receiving trust in God</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Mark 1: 15, 21; 2, 3-11; Luke 7: 47-48</i> <br>
            “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.”... Then they 
            came to Capernaum, and on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. They came bringing to him a paralytic 
            carried by four men. Unable to get near Jesus because of the crowd, they opened up the roof above him. After they had 
            broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the 
            paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.” Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves, “Why does this 
            man speak that way? He is blaspheming. Who but God alone can forgive sins?” Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they 
            were thinking to themselves, so he said, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the 
            paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, pick up your mat and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man 
            has authority to forgive sins on earth”— he said to the paralytic, “I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home.”... So 
            I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves 
            little.” He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

        <h3>Fourth Luminous Mystery: The Transfiguration</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of receiving spiritual courage</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Matthew 17: 1-8</i> <br>
            After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was 
            transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah 
            appeared to them, conversing with him. Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, 
            I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, behold, a bright 
            cloud cast a shadow over them, then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; 
            listen to him.” When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrate and were very much afraid. But Jesus came and touched them, 
            saying, “Rise, and do not be afraid.” And when the disciples raised their eyes, they saw no one else but Jesus alone.

        <h3>Fifth Luminous Mystery: The Institution of the Eucharist</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for the grace of going to the Eucharistic Adoration as much as possible</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>John 6: 53-58; Luke 22: 14-20</i> <br>
            Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have 
            life within you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my flesh is 
            true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. Just as the living Father 
            sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. This is the bread that 
            came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever.”... When the hour came,
            he took his place at table with the apostles. He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, 
            for, I tell you, I shall not eat it [again] until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,
            “Take this and share it among yourselves; for I tell you [that] from this time on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the 
            kingdom of God comes.” Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which will be 
            given for you; do this in memory of me.” And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, 
            which will be shed for you.
